My rails + java spike experiment to use rails' actionpack frontend plus java's spring & hibernate backend.

Why I wanted to use rails controller & view for my web layer?
- restful routing
- form builder
- dislike jsp, likes haml (or even erb)

Unfortunately
- route generation and form builder doesn't work with hibernate java domain model
- annoying with restarts after every change
